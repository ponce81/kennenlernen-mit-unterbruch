                    <p>I just came from the gym, completely destroyed hahaha, but with a nice sensation that I could
                      train and do something good for my body, I cooked some turkey with paprika and rice. Nothing
                      speciall but it taste good. Now I am just sitting in my reading chair and improvising some lines
                      for you.</p>

                    <p>Today I was thinking about what do I want to tell you, and through the day this topic has been
                      fixed in my mind... lets talk about concerts!</p>

                    <p>I already told you about my Manu Chao experience, it was a great concert and meeting him was a
                      really cool thing. Also because I got to live it with my best friend. Friendship is another topic
                      that I will talk about one of these days.</p>

                    <p>I have so many good memories about live music, I can tell you about my first concert when I was
                      15, this was in the bullfighting arena in Guadalajara, a very popular place where I got to see
                      great bands (at least very popular in Mexico) and one of the coolest the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.
                    </p>

                    <p>I've also been to many festivals during the last years in Europe, but if I could say which is my
                      favorite concert of all the time I have no doubt... <b>Radiohead in Berlin</b></p>

                    <p>I think in some party when I was at the Uni (might be under the influence of alcohol 8-¦ ) I told
                      a friend of mine, lets make a deal and do whatever is necesary to see Radiohead in Berlin... He
                      agreed and we continue as normal... anyway time passed and for some reason I was living in Berlin
                      and there was this festival, the Lollapalooza</p>

                    <p>The festival was for 2 days, the first day played as last act Paul Kalkbrenner, electro chill
                      music with a Berlinerish vibe, it was amazing!</p>

                    <p>Of course I was waiting for Radiohead the next day, I was there with a group of acquaintances, so
                      when the time for Radiohead was approaching I told them I wanted to go to the front, they wanted
                      to keep chilling and we got separated, anyway, that is not that important, the important thing
                      here was that I was on the front, not on the front front, but I had a really good spot, perfect to
                      see them and enjoy them</p>

                    <p>Then it started, song after song they were better and better, it was great in every sense. One of
                      the most impresive things was the mood of the singer. I don't know how good do you know Radiohead,
                      well let me tell you something, is a depressing band hahaha, is a melancholic, darky, gray band
                      with amazing musicians. the lead singer Thom Yorke, he was the face of depression, struggle, and
                      melancholy itself. Maybe thats why I like them a lot</p>

                    <p>But then something amazing happen in the concert, he started to smile, to make silly jokes and
                      dance like a crazy person... he had a constant battle with his demons for years and at least for
                      that single night, he won a battle, he got ride of them and invited them to celebrate
                      life...</p>

                    <p>It was a long concert but it felt like a blink of an eye... but it was perfect, there is this
                      song called "Let down" and the guitars are just amazing, they play this song and I could
                      appreciate live how the 3 guitars go up and down at the perfect moment, the perfect note with the
                      perfect rythm. Is a beautiful song</p>

                    <p>Another highlight was, that I had a mexican flag and at some point between songs I grabbed it and
                      showed it up high, and the guitarrist saw me direct in the eyes, smiled and say "Ah Mexico, viva
                      Mexico" and put his hand on his heart... It was just a great feeling, the cherry on the top for a
                      night to remember</p>

                    <p>There are so many other memories related to music, great concerts and so on, but those I could
                      tell you on a long summer hot day, laying somewhere doing nothing but getting to know us more</p>

                    <p>Do you have a best concert ever experience?</p>
