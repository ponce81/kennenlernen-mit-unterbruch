                    <p>
                      I've always believed that destiny plays a role in our lives. It has something poetic and nostalgic
                      at the same time. Someone put us here in this earth, in this time and under these conditions.
                      Gave us some tools like Intelligence and physical qualities... What we do with these resources
                      under these conditions is entirely up to us.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      And this is something that has marked me since I was a teenager. Decisions... Now the tree
                      theory... Life is like a tree,
                      we start on the roots, which symbolizes our family. We grew up in a more or less (hopefully) safe
                      environment
                      and at some point we started to be confronted with decisions. This is where the stem, the trunk
                      starts to diverge. With each decision a new branch opens up to us. And to comeback to a past state
                      is
                      dificult almost impossible.
                      That's why decisions are important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      So, which have been my most life changing decisions that I had to make?
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Quit football to become an Engineer - Age 18 years old </li>
                      <li>Study in Germany (and stay here in Europe) - Age 25 years old</li>
                      <li>Ending some major relationships </li>
                      <!-- <ul>
                        <li>Age 19 - First one. It lasted only 1 year</li>
                        <li>Age 32 - It lasted almost 5 years</li>
                        <li>Age 38 - It lasted 2.5 years</li>
                      </ul> -->
                    </ul>


                    <p>
                      How do I feel about my biggest decisions so far? ... Well... most of the times is "No regrets",
                      they've made me the person that I
                      am, and eventhough I am not nearly close to perfection (and don't want to be) I am happy most of
                      the times with the person that I am.
                    </p>

                    <p>But some other times I ask myself a lot of things, the what ifs... Let me start with an
                      example... Football. I started playing when I was 7 years old, I wasn't that good, but I trained
                      long and hard, and when I was 15 I was both in the school first team and in the young team of one
                      of the most important teams in Mexico. At the age of 16 I signed my first contract as a football
                      player, started travelling and playing in stadiums. Wherever we went, people ask us for our
                      autograph, it was crazy and I was living the dream.</p>
                    <p>Then I turned 18 and finished high school, and I knew I had to make a decision. I was good with
                      my head, studies. And I also was good playing football, I knew I could make it to the first team
                      and maybe national.<br>And I choose study and become an engineer.</p>
                    <p>While I was in the university the guy who took my place in the team got called to the first team
                      as a professional, big thing. And then he got better and better at the point that he played 3
                      World cups for the Mexican National Team.<br> Deep down inside me, I had to prove myself that I
                      could be as succesful in the studies as I could have been as a football player. I don't know if
                      that was the right mindset, but it became my engine, my motivation and put my heart and soul on
                      studies and work.</p>
                    <p>I put aside a lot of times being young and happy... and trade it for trying to be successfull.
                      One thing that I know is that because of those times that I stayed at home learning and working on
                      some projects, those times are the reason that I am here, life got me to this point and that, I
                      don't regret it</p>
                    <p>Now the question that I have had the last couple of years is when is enough, until which point I
                      have to sacrifice some things for success, and what is success... What I know is, that it is time
                      for me to focus my effort in my private life... Being successfull might be to be happy, and I want
                      to be happy and I am working on that.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Today while I was writting my learnings from past relationships I took this notebook, which
                      sometimes use to just put my thoughts on paper, in order. And I found some interesting pages. One
                      of this is the following. I wrote it somewhere between March 2023 and July 2023 while I was living
                      in Lugano.</p>

                    <p>It might sound a bit depressing, but is more somehow like a philosophical retoric speech with
                      myself</p>

                      <h3>Notes about decisions</h3>

                      <p>In a room, watching, meditating, he realizes that his life was not what he had in mind how it
                        would
                        be. He doesn't know how he got to this point, but in that instant his mind travels to that point
                        of inflexion, that moment when his life could have been different in case he had taken some
                        other decision, taken the other path.</p>

                      <p>In life we had a lot of inflexion points, the tree theory, the branches until reach the leafs.
                      </p>
                      <p>What is better? To reach the top and see the world from that perspective? </p>
                      <p>Or stay in the middle where the fruits grow, where the flowers bloom...</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>For everyone there is a different story , during a whole life a lot fo different stories.</p>
                      <p>In a room with a beautiful view to the alps, surrounded by all these luxuries which never in
                        his life thought he could have , and never look for, in that moment he realizes ( or asked
                        himself) that is not the place where he wanted to be, not the life that he imagined he would
                        have.</p>
                      <p>Where is this boy with happy eyes and big smile (with his big teeth). Who dreamed about
                        changing the world or have a positive impact in society. Is that what he wanted? Or he just only
                        wanted to be happy...</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>I only want to be happy...</p>
                    <p>I have grown a lot the last couple of years, I know what my priorities are... being happy and
                      enjoy life. And I have been doing it, and that got me to the point to focus in my private life.
                      Family, friends and now hopefully you, a partner... I say that bluntly and direct...</p>

                    <p>You know... these thoughts and points of views not a lot of people now about them, I might told
                      some of this to my mom, but not all of them. Even my best friends doesn't know about these
                      thoughts and feelings. These pages are private, are my private notes. And here I am, being
                      vulnerable to you. I don't know how and why but I trust you with these private thoughts. It is me,
                      opening myself to you, letting my guard down, hoping for the best. Taking a leap of faith.</p>
                    <p>Have a good travel and enjoy the time with your favorite girls...</p>
